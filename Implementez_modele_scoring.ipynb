    "# Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## New:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The idea is to change the threshold in LogisticRegression, on which it divises positives from negatives. This information can be withdrawn with roc curve, right? But on roc curve you have the rates on every probability threshold, right? And on precision-recall curve as well. How to get access to confusion matrix at any threshold?\n",
    "2. Or, if it's not possible, how to deduce either from ROC_AUC rates, or from Precision_Recall rates, at which threshold the ratio of False_Positive to False_Negative is N? (for example N=10, but can be 8 or 22 - depends how much costs to the bank the error of a wrong positive prediction vs a wrong negative one).\n",
    "3. Gridsearch, the paramter \"return_train_score\", does it impact on the refit? Or it only it makes it show the train score? I'd like to make the refit based on the test score, not hte train one.\n",
    "4. __The main question:__ the maskers in shap.LinearExplainer. my code doesn't work without it, but there are many examples where it's not required. Even on the sites in the recommendation list in \"Ressources\" section. How the code of other people works without these maskers?\n",
    "5. What's the difference between the histogram HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START and othrs, why this one looks like sawteeth but not the other variables histograms? How can I make the curve smoother?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Old:\n",
    "1. \"Get feture importances\", the section in the end of the notebook. How to get the features out from the pipeline, which is the outer wrapper? Or how to get the features from ColumnTransformer (which is called Preprocessor)?\n",
    "\n",
    "I found in internet that this job is impossible when the column transformer contains Pipelines. But the inverse isn't mentioned as impossible.\n",
    "This source https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep007/proposal.html sets the problem but doesn't offer a solution. It suggests to add feature_names_in_ attribute and get_feature_names_out method to fitted estimators. But I don't see how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. kde graph, is there a way to reduce the wiggling of the curve? Can I stay with distribution and not pass to histograms? because of the difference of the scale."

    "### Values imputing strategy: Cautious strategy\n",
    "The strategy is not the same for filling the train set and the test set:\n",
    "- For the test set, if we don't know the value, we shall use the most \"risky\" variant: the value that gives the highest rate of positive target.\n",
    "- For the train set, we know the traget. So, if the target is negative, no need to set the parameter to the \"most risky\" category. I will assign it to the a category (more on that later), if the number of missing values is below the limit (let's say arbitrarily, 5%) and to a standalone \"unknown\" category, if the number of missing values is above this limit.\n",
    "- How to choose a category: we already know the target value. So, for the positive target we give the \"most risky\" value to the unknown. For the negative target, we give the most frequent value, doesn't matter what's the risk (can be the most risky, the least, or somewhere in the middle, we just take the most frequent).\n",
    "- The drawback of such a distiction on the category: we risk to overfit our model. But, we will overfit it in a lopsided way: the model will tend to give more importance on the imputed features to lead to positive target. But this drawback plays on our side at the end of the game: as on test set we impute the \"most risky\" value every time, the model will give more false negatives, but will be much less likely to let pass the false positives. That means, we can explain the refuse to a client based on the features that were not provided by the client, so the client knows what cells (s)he has to modify or fill.\n",
    "- How we detect \"the most risky\" category: by groupby-aggregation test. Look the correlation between positive target (credit fail) and different values. See the proportion of people who failed to pay their credit for every value. The value with the highest proportion of positive target is \"the most risky\" one.\n",
    "- How to store \"the most risky\" values: maybe as a dictionary. The key is the feature that we want to impute, the value is the most risky category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to apply cautious strategy\n",
    "When we suppose that a false positive is significantly more costly to the bank than a false negative is. If it happens that the difference between the cost of false negative and false positive is insignificant for the bank, we can pass to simplified strategy.\n",
    "### Values imputing strategy: Simplified strategy\n",
    "Impute with \"the most risky\" value for test set and with the most frequent value for the train set.\n",
    "### Values imputing strategy: Simplest strategy\n",
    "Impute with the most frequent value for both train and test sets.\n",
    "### How to handle the values which are already imputed as \"unknown\", \"not specified\", \"XNA\" or similar\n",
    "When you look through unique values, you might notice that some categorical values are filled with \"unknown\", \"not_specified\", \"XNA\" or similar kinds of values. All that means \"NaN\", basically.\n",
    "The best of all would be to ask a confirmation on the business side, whether it's indeed smth like \"this info is lacking\", which equelas NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is so, the best is to delete these values/replace by \"NaN\", and then apply the standard algorithm, described before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: GENDER_CODE. Among 307511 applications, 4 applicants have \"XNA\" value. It's like \"nan\", just it's filled with text. So I will replace \"XNA\" with \"nan\", and then treat it along the general algorithm:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Train-test split, do it once, and make all the later comparisons on the same splitting. The random state is selected in the beginning of the notebook as rasta.\n",
    "2. Test with DummyClassifier, to see what are the metrics for the predictions unrelated to the data (but related to the target).\n",
    "2. Build the preprocessor (standardscaler for numeric, onehotencoder for categorical).\n",
    "3. Take into account the method of imbalanced classes handling: it can be class_weight=\"balanced\" parameter of the model/estimator, or it can be simple SMOTE (oversampling, generation of new samples); here I don't try the option of SMOTE followed by undersampling (like Tomek Links or ENN).  \n",
    "In fact, you can't insert the SMOTE step into your pipeline, because the pipeline is a fixed sequence of steps, and I want SMOTE to be the optional/conditional step, because it depends whether I use SMOTE or class_weight='balanced'. So, I can either make two different pipelines - with SMOTE step present and skipped, or I can not make the pipeline at all - just use the transformed X_train and y_train, transformed with the preprocessor.  \n",
    "3. With the help of cross-validation, select the best model(LogReg, RandForest, PassAgressive, LightGBM), the best parameters (different for each model, are given in advance with a dictionart that will be passed to param_grid), the best conditions of imbalanced class handling. At this step I use the roc-auc score: the best model and combination of parameters is the one with highest AUC. I will display the personalized metric as well, but only for observation. The refitting of the models is on roc_auc on this step, and the best_params_ are defined according to the highest roc_auc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then I take the model that was found to be the best according to roc_auc (now I know it is LogReg 2022-01-25), and use this model for further tests. I make the tests on only this model, but I look for the best parameters and the best conditions of imbalanced class handling according to my personalized metric, that I define myself (I use 10 * False_neg + 1 * False_pos).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once the best parameters are found for this personalized metric, be they the same as with roc_auc or different, I take these new parameters and train my model with them.  \n",
    "For this final training I don't need a cross-validation any more. So, I will make a new pipeline, with preprocessor, (then maybe SMOTE, if it works better than class_weight='balanced' in the model), then the model. This way the model is trained on 80% of the data, not on 64% as during cross-validation."

It takes input in the same form as the model, but for just a single sample with a binary mask, then returns an iterable of masked samples. These masked samples will then be evaluated using the model function and the outputs averaged. slice() model(* masker(* args, mask=mask)).mean() As a shortcut for the standard masking using by SHAP you can pass a background data matrix instead of a function and that matrix will be used for masking. Domain specific masking functions are available in shap such as shap.ImageMasker for images and shap.TokenMasker for text. In addition to determining how to replace hidden features, the masker can also constrain the rules of the cooperative game used to explain the model. For example shap.TabularMasker(data, hclustering=”correlation”) will enforce a hierarchial clustering of coalitions for the game (in this special case the attributions are known as the Owen values)."
