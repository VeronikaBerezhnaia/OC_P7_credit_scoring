    " Most features are created by applying min, max, mean, sum and var functions to grouped tables. \n",
    " Little feature selection is done and overfitting might be a problem since many features are related.\n",
    " The following key ideas were used:\n",
    " - Divide or subtract important features to get rates (like annuity and income)\n",
    " - In Bureau Data: create specific features for Active credits and Closed credits\n",
    " - In Previous Applications: create specific features for Approved and Refused applications\n",
    " - Modularity: one function for each table (except bureau_balance and application_test)\n",
    " - One-hot encoding for categorical features\n",
    " All tables are joined with the application DF using the SK_ID_CURR key (except bureau_balance).\n",
    " You can use LightGBM with KFold or Stratified KFold.\n",
    "\n",
    " Update 16/06/2018:\n",
    " - Added Payment Rate feature\n",
    " - Removed index from features\n",
    " - Use standard KFold CV (not stratified)"

    "### Strategy\n",
    "#### Cautious strategy\n",
    "The strategy is not the same for filling the train set and the test set:\n",
    "- For the test set, if we don't know the value, we shall use the most \"risky\" variant: the value that gives the highest rate of positive target.\n",
    "- For the train set, we know the traget. So, if the target is negative, no need to set the parameter to the \"most risky\" category. I will assign it to the a category (more on that later), if the number of missing values is below the limit (let's say arbitrarily, 5%) and to a standalone \"unknown\" category, if the number of missing values is above this limit.\n",
    "- How to choose a category: we already know the target value. So, for the positive target we give the \"most risky\" value to the unknown. For the negative target, we give the most frequent value, doesn't matter what's the risk (can be the most risky, the least, or somewhere in the middle, we just take the most frequent).\n",
    "- The drawback of such a distiction on the category: we risk to overfit our model. But, we will overfit it in a lopsided way: the model will tend to give more importance on the imputed features to lead to positive target. But this drawback plays on our side at the end of the game: as on test set we impute the \"most risky\" value every time, the model will give more false negatives, but will be much less likely to let pass the false positives. That means, we can explain the refuse to a client based on the features that were not provided by the client, so the client knows what cells (s)he has to modify or fill.\n",
    "- How we detect \"the most risky\" category: by groupby-aggregation test. Look the correlation between positive target (credit fail) and different values. See the proportion of people who failed to pay their credit for every value. The value with the highest proportion of positive target is \"the most risky\" one.\n",
    "- How to store \"the most risky\" values: maybe as a dictionary. The key is the feature that we want to impute, the value is the most risky category.\n",
    "#### When to apply cautious strategy\n",
    "When we suppose that a false positive is significantly more costly to the bank than a false negative is. If it happens that the difference between the cost of false negative and false positive is insignificant for the bank, we can pass to simplified strategy.\n",
    "#### Simplified strategy\n",
    "Impute with \"the most risky\" value for test set and with the most frequent value for the train set.\n",
    "#### Simplest strategy\n",
    "Impute with the most frequent value for both train and test sets.\n",
    "#### How to handle the values which are already imputed as \"unknown\", \"not specified\", \"XNA\" or similar\n",
    "When you look through unique values, you might notice that some categorical values are filled with \"unknown\", \"not_specified\", \"XNA\" or similar kinds of values. All that means \"NaN\", basically.\n",
    "The best of all would be to ask a confirmation on the business side, whether it's indeed smth like \"this info is lacking\", which equelas NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is so, the best is to delete these values/replace by \"NaN\", and then apply the standard algorithm, described before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: GENDER_CODE. Among 307511 applications, 4 applicants have \"XNA\" value. It's like \"nan\", just it's filled with text. So I will replace \"XNA\" with \"nan\", and then treat it along the general algorithm:\n",

    "    -with  most risky for train set positive target, \n",
    "    - with most frequent for train set negtive target.\n",
    "The most risky value from groupby-aggreagtion test is \"M\"."
